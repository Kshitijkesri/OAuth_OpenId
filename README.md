# OAuth_OpenId
OAUTH OpenId Connect using Identity Server4
This Project use IdentityServer4 to create OAuth Server.

#Identity Server

IdentityServer is used because it implements both OAuth 2. 0 and OpenID Connect as well as some of the other specifications. Security is rarely easy to understand and to apply to your projects. But IdentityServer makes it a lot easier to add this building block to our project. And what makes IdentityServer so good is that it's built by industry experts, it's open source, and it's a project that is constantly evolving, and it's working with both the older as well as the newer ASP. NET versions. So no matter if you're looking at ASP. NET Core or if you're working with Web API or MVC, IdentityServer will certainly be a good fit for your application when you want to apply OAuth.
